%------------------------------------

The experiments concluded that Genetic Algorithms can be an interesting pathway to parametrize features inspired from Reinforcement Learning (here the \textit{Q-table}).
However RL still vastly outperforms GA on the studied task, supposedly due to the precision required to improve pole balancing and a very large hyper-parameters search space.
GA may thus be better suited (and possibly outperform RL) on tasks with a larger search space or requiring less precision, where its parallel search could allow it to converge to a viable solution faster while not being impaired by its large update steps.

%The conclusion should summarise your main results and main points from the discussion.
%A rule of thumb is to not present any new information (information not found in the results or discussion).

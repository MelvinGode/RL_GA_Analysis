\begin{abstract}
%Machine learning includes a variety of techniques for solving specific problems. 
This paper explores the comparative advantages and disadvantages of using a genetic algorithm versus a reinforcement learning approach for the pole balancing problem. 
Both methods were subjected to identical training and testing conditions to ensure a fair comparison. 
The results demonstrated that reinforcement learning, due to its simplicity of implementation and superior environmental comprehension, outperformed the genetic algorithm in this scenario. 
We also highlight GA's ability to converge to a viable very quick and stylistic differences when playing the game between the two algorithms.
This finding reinforces the prevalent use of reinforcement learning in similar contexts and highlights its potential for applications in dynamic environments.
